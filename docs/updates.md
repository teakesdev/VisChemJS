To Update:

1. Click to create double bond

2. Fix up UI/UX

3. Highlight atoms or bonds when hovering over them

4. Fix big blank area around charge (maybe redo charge box for each molecule)

5. Fix charge not factoring in triple bond

6. 

Less Critical:

1. Make bonds always be a set length and automatically restructure to "evenly split the pie". Also check other editors to copy features.

2. Rewrite in Python?
